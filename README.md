pagina EPUB-Checker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paginagmbh/EPUB-Checker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paginagmbh/EPUB-Checker)
===================

Standalone "EPUB-Checker" application for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

With the pagina EPUB-Checker one can easily validate eBooks in the EPUB format. The test mechanisms of the EPUB-Checker are based on the official open-source [EPUBCheck tool](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck) (version 4.1.1).

Features
--------

pagina EPUB-Checker wraps up this tool and offers some additional features like:

* Graphical user interface
* Drag & drop EPUB to validate
* Ability to validate expanded (unzipped) EPUB's
  * Expanded folders are automatically zipped up to an EPUB file upon validation
  * The generated EPUB file will be saved if it is valid
* Localized GUI and errors and warnings:
  * English
  * German
  * French
  * Spanish
  * Japanese
  * Portuguese (Brazil)
  * Russian (messages incomplete)
  * Dutch (messages only, english GUI)
  * Czech (GUI only, english messages)
  * Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) (GUI only, english messages)

pagina EPUB-Checker doesn't need to be installed and therefore works on portable USB devices as well as on computers with restricted rights.

Build the app
-------------

In order to build the Linux JAR, the Mac App and the Windows EXE files you just have to run

```
mvn clean package
```

from the root directory of this project.

### Important Note
The maven packaging process runs a Mac OS specific `codesign` task to sign and verify the Mac App with our (private) Apple Developer Certificate. Therefore, this part will only work on one of our company Mac's.

To be able to build packages on other Mac systems or on Windows, just skip the codesigning task with the following option:

```
mvn -Dmaven.codesign.skip=true clean package
```

or during `release:prepare` phase (with `maven-release-plugin`):

```
mvn -Darguments=-Dmaven.codesign.skip=true clean release:prepare
```
