The modules in this directory are part of the schema that defines 
a vocabulary and grammar for EPUB3 XHTML Content Documents [1], 
based on W3C XHTML5 [2], with IDPF/EPUB extensions. 

The modules are derived from the schemas used in the validator.nu 
service [3].

The schema for for EPUB3 XHTML Content Documents is not continuously 
updated to reflect the latest version of the W3C HTML5 specification; 
it is a static representation of the EPUB3 XHTML Content Document 
definition, and changes to it occur only in conjunction with new 
releases of the EPUB3 specification.

Note - as the W3C HTML5 specification becomes a Final Recommendation, 
it is anticipated that IDPF will no longer maintain its own complete 
schema.
